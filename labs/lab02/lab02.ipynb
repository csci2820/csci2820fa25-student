When we refer to the output associated with a specific vector, say $V$, we use the notation $T(V)$.  (*This notation is read \"$T$ of $V$\"*).

    "In the study of mechanics, shear forces occur when one force acts on some part of a body while a second force acts on another part of the body but in the opposite direction. To visualize this, imagine a deck of playing cards resting on the table, and then while resting your hand on top of the deck, sliding your hand parallel to the table. \n",

    "A **shear** transformation is any transformation that shifts points in a given direction by an amount proportional to their original (signed) distance from the line that is parallel to the movement of direction and that passes through the origin. For example, a horizontal shear applied to a vector would add to the vector's $x$-coordinate a value scaled by the value of its $y$-coordinate (or subtract, if the $y$-coordinate was negative). A vertical shear is expressed as a matrix in the form of the first matrix below, and a horizontal shear with the second where $k \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is called the **shearing factor**.\n",

    "Computer graphics essentially consist of a large number of basic geometric shapes such as triangles or quadrilaterals, defined by their vertexes (corners).  The ability to manipulate these shapes efficiently is a fundamental necessity in the field of computer graphics.  Linear transformations can be used to generate complex shapes from basic shapes through effects such as shearing and reflection, and can also be used to rotate and translate shapes in order to create a sequence of images needed for an animated scene.\n",
    "\n",
    "The software responsible for rendering three-dimensional scenes in modern video games must process the coordinates of millions of vertexes in each frame of animation.  Typical hardware used for running the software will be able to generate around 60 frames per second.  In addition to the placement of vertexes in a scene, there are other computations required, such as those to provide color and shading, and then to project the three-dimensional scene onto the two-dimensional screen.  In this context, the efficiency of the algorithms, software, and hardware all play a major role in the quality of the end result.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The use of matrix multiplication to manipulate coordinates for computer graphics has two primary advantages.  Matrix representations can be used to merge multiple transformations together into a single transformation.  For example, instead of applying a rotation followed by a scaling transformation, the two operations can easily be merged into a single operation by multiplying the associated matrices as we did earlier.  The other advantage to organizing the calculations into matrix multiplications is that dedicated hardware (graphics processing units) is designed specifically to handle these calculations in large numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The construction of matrices to carry out rotations, reflections, and shears, has already been demonstrated in [Planar Transformations](Planar_Transformations.ipynb).  Here we show how to use matrix multiplication to carry out a translation, which is not a linear transformation.  "
