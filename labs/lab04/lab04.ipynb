However, consulting notes from the class videos, and web pages that explain the material taught in class but do NOT show a solution to the lab problem in question are permissible to view.  Clearly, there's a fuzzy line here between a valid use of resources and cheating. To avoid this line, one should merely consult the course videos, the course textbooks, and references that contain syntax and/or formulas.\n",

    "# Diagonal factorization\n",
    "\n",
    "The calculation that we used to verify the eigenvalues and eigenvectors is also very useful to construct another important matrix factorization.  Suppose that $A$ is an $n\\times n$ matrix, $D$ is a diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues of $A$ along its diagonal, and $S$ is the $n\\times n$ matrix with the eigenvectors of $A$ as its columns.  We have just seen that $AS=SD$.  If $S$ is invertible, we may also write $A=SDS^{-1}$, which is known as the **diagonalization** of $A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The diagonalization of $A$ is important because it provides us with a complete description of the action of $A$ in terms of its eigenvectors.  Consider an arbitrary vector $X$, and the product $AX$, computed by using the three factors in the diagonalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "- $S^{-1}X$ computes the coordinates of $X$ in terms of the eigenvectors of $A$.\n",
    "- Multiplication by $D$ then simply scales each coordinate by the corresponding eigenvalue.\n",
    "- Multiplication by $S$ gives the results with respect to the standard basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This understanding does not provide a more efficient way of computing the product $AX$, but it does provide a much more general way of understanding the result of a matrix-vector multiplication.  As we will see in the next section, the diagonalization also provides a significant shortcut in computing powers of $A$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that diagonalization of an $n\\times n$ matrix $A$ is not possible when the eigenvectors of $A$ form a linearly dependent set.  In that case the eigenvectors do not span $\\mathbb{R}^n$, which means that not every $X$ in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ can be written as a linear combination of the eigenvectors.  In terms of the computation above, $S$ will not be invertible exactly in this case."
