Suppose that $A$ is an $n\\times n$ matrix, $D$ is a diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues of $A$ along its diagonal, and $P$ is the $n\\times n$ matrix with the eigenvectors of $A$ as its columns.  We have just seen that $AP=PD$.  If $P$ is invertible, we may also write $A=PDP^{-1}$, which is known as the **diagonalization** of $A$.\n",

As we will see in the next section, the diagonalization also provides a significant shortcut in computing powers of $A$.  \n",

    "It should be noted that diagonalization of an $n\\times n$ matrix $A$ is not possible when the eigenvectors of $A$ form a linearly dependent set.  In that case the eigenvectors do not span $\\mathbb{R}^n$, which means that not every $X$ in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ can be written as a linear combination of the eigenvectors.  In terms of the computation above, $P$ will not be invertible exactly in this case."
